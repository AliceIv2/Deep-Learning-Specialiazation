# Week 1 

## Practical Aspects of Deep Learning 

Discover and experiment with a variety of different initialization methods,
apply L2 regularization and dropout to avoid model overfitting, 
then apply gradient checking to identify errors in a fraud detection model.

1. Setting up your Machine Learning Application. 
2. Regularizing your Neural Network. 
3. Setting up your Optimization Problem.
